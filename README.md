# Genesis Frontier 🌍

A browser-based multi-stage terraforming simulation game where you transform hostile alien worlds into thriving colonies.

## Features

- **Multi-Stage Progression System**: Transform planets through 6 distinct stages from hostile world to thriving colony
- **Multiple Planet Types**: Cold, Hot, Desert, and Barren planets, each with unique challenges
- **Comprehensive Terraforming Facilities**:
  - 🔥 Heating Facilities (melt ice on cold planets)
  - ❄️ Cooling Facilities (lower temperature on hot planets)
  - 💧 Humidifiers (increase atmospheric humidity)
  - 🌱 O2 Generators (increase oxygen levels)
  - 🏭 CO2 Scrubbers (reduce carbon dioxide)
  - 🌾 Soil Enrichment Stations
  - 💦 Water Extraction Plants
  - 🌬️ Pollution Filters
  - ☀️ Solar Power Arrays
  - 🏡 Agricultural Greenhouses
  - 🏙️ Habitat Domes
- **Dynamic Environmental System**: Natural changes, resource cycles, and environmental interactions
- **Environmental Collapse Mechanics**: Mismanagement leads to planetary collapse
- **Resource Management**: Balance energy, credits, and population
- **Stage-Based Building Unlocks**: Progress unlocks new technologies
- **Alert System**: Warnings for resource shortages and environmental dangers

## Quick Start

1. Open `index.html` in a modern web browser
2. Choose your planet type (or get a random one)
3. Build facilities to terraform the planet
4. Click "Next Turn" to progress
5. Reach Stage 5 to win!

## How to Play

1. **Analyze Your Planet**: Each planet type has different starting conditions
2. **Build Appropriate Facilities**: Cold planets need heating, hot planets need cooling
3. **Manage Resources**: Watch your energy and credits carefully
4. **Progress Through Stages**: Meet requirements to unlock new buildings
5. **Avoid Collapse**: Keep all environmental factors in safe ranges
6. **Win the Game**: Create a self-sustaining colony with 500+ population

## Technology

- Pure HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript (ES6+)
- No dependencies or build process required
- Responsive design for desktop and mobile
- Fully client-side game logic

## Game Mechanics Highlights

### Atmospheric Control
- O2 and CO2 management with natural exchanges
- Temperature affects water states (ice, liquid, vapor)
- Pollution from industrial facilities

### Water Management
- Water extraction from underground sources
- Ice melting on cold planets through heating
- Condensation on hot planets through cooling
- Humidity control for desert environments

### Soil Enrichment
- Soil quality affects agriculture
- Natural degradation without maintenance
- Required for greenhouse operation

### Energy Requirements
- All facilities consume energy
- Solar arrays produce clean energy
- Energy shortages cause system failures

### Multi-Stage Unlocks
- Stage 0: Basic temperature control
- Stage 1: Atmospheric processing begins
- Stage 2: Environmental refinement
- Stage 3: Agriculture and ecosystems
- Stage 4: Colonization with habitats
- Stage 5: Self-sustaining colony (Victory!)

### Environmental Consequences
- Temperature extremes cause collapse
- Toxic atmospheres prevent life
- Resource depletion ends colonization
- Pollution crises require immediate action

## Future Plans

- Multiplayer features
- Random events system
- Research technology tree
- Multiple planets management
- Visual planet rendering
- Achievement system
