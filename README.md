# Genesis Frontier

A sci-fi strategy game about colonizing and terraforming a hostile, uninhabitable planet.

## Overview

Genesis Frontier is a deep, challenging simulation where players must establish humanity's first colony on Genesis Prime - a toxic, scorching, and completely hostile world. Starting with just a small survival pod and limited resources, players must overcome extreme environmental hazards, establish critical life support systems, build an industrial base, and ultimately begin the centuries-long process of terraforming the planet into a second home for humanity.

## Game Concept

The game challenges players to transform the most inhospitable environment imaginable into a thriving human settlement. Every decision matters, from choosing which critical system to build first, to managing scarce resources, to responding to environmental disasters. The progression spans from desperate day-to-day survival to multi-generational planetary engineering.

## Core Gameplay Features

- **Hostile Environment:** Every aspect of Genesis Prime is designed to kill you - toxic atmosphere, extreme heat, acid rain, dust storms, volcanic eruptions, and radiation
- **Survival Pressure:** Limited starting resources create time pressure to establish water, oxygen, and food production before supplies run out
- **Resource Management:** Complex production chains where every resource matters - water feeds electrolysis for oxygen, which supports colonists who operate machinery
- **Technology Progression:** Research tree spanning from basic survival tech to advanced terraforming megastructures
- **Dynamic Events:** Environmental disasters, equipment failures, and random events keep players adapting
- **Long-Term Vision:** The ultimate goal of transforming the planet takes centuries of in-game time, creating a true legacy experience

## The Challenge

Can you guide humanity through its most ambitious undertaking? Will your colony survive the first 90 days? Can you establish a self-sustaining industrial base? Will future generations see breathable air and blue skies?

**Genesis Prime shows no mercy. Every victory is earned.**

## Development Status

This project is currently in the concept and design phase. The detailed planet concept and game mechanics documentation establish the foundation for a unique and challenging strategy game experience.
