# Genesis Frontier 🌍

A browser-based multi-stage terraforming simulation game where you transform hostile alien worlds into thriving colonies.

## Features

- **Multi-Stage Progression System**: Transform planets through 6 distinct stages from hostile world to thriving colony
- **Multiple Planet Types**: Cold, Hot, Desert, and Barren planets, each with unique challenges
- **Comprehensive Terraforming Facilities**:
  - 🔥 Heating Facilities (melt ice on cold planets)
  - ❄️ Cooling Facilities (lower temperature on hot planets)
  - 💧 Humidifiers (increase atmospheric humidity)
  - 🌱 O2 Generators (increase oxygen levels)
  - 🏭 CO2 Scrubbers (reduce carbon dioxide)
  - 🌾 Soil Enrichment Stations
  - 💦 Water Extraction Plants
  - 🌬️ Pollution Filters
  - ☀️ Solar Power Arrays
  - 🏡 Agricultural Greenhouses
  - 🏙️ Habitat Domes
- **Dynamic Environmental System**: Natural changes, resource cycles, and environmental interactions
- **Environmental Collapse Mechanics**: Mismanagement leads to planetary collapse
- **Resource Management**: Balance energy, credits, and population
- **Stage-Based Building Unlocks**: Progress unlocks new technologies
- **Alert System**: Warnings for resource shortages and environmental dangers

## Quick Start

1. Open `index.html` in a modern web browser
2. Choose your planet type (or get a random one)
3. Build facilities to terraform the planet
4. Click "Next Turn" to progress
5. Reach Stage 5 to win!

## How to Play

1. **Analyze Your Planet**: Each planet type has different starting conditions
2. **Build Appropriate Facilities**: Cold planets need heating, hot planets need cooling
3. **Manage Resources**: Watch your energy and credits carefully
4. **Progress Through Stages**: Meet requirements to unlock new buildings
5. **Avoid Collapse**: Keep all environmental factors in safe ranges
6. **Win the Game**: Create a self-sustaining colony with 500+ population

# Genesis Frontier

A sci-fi strategy game about colonizing and terraforming a hostile, uninhabitable planet.

## Overview

Genesis Frontier is a deep, challenging simulation where players must establish humanity's first colony on Genesis Prime - a toxic, scorching, and completely hostile world. Starting with just a small survival pod and limited resources, players must overcome extreme environmental hazards, establish critical life support systems, build an industrial base, and ultimately begin the centuries-long process of terraforming the planet into a second home for humanity.

## Game Concept

The game challenges players to transform the most inhospitable environment imaginable into a thriving human settlement. Every decision matters, from choosing which critical system to build first, to managing scarce resources, to responding to environmental disasters. The progression spans from desperate day-to-day survival to multi-generational planetary engineering.

## Documentation

### 📄 [Planet Concept](PLANET_CONCEPT.md)
Detailed concept for Genesis Prime, including:
- Atmospheric composition and toxicity
- Temperature extremes and environmental hazards  
- Terrain features and geography
- Resource availability and scarcity
- Why humans cannot survive without technology
- Early structures and technologies needed for survival
- Terraforming progression over centuries

### 🎮 [Game Mechanics](GAME_MECHANICS.md)
Technical specifications and gameplay systems:
- Resource management and production chains
- Building catalog with stats and costs
- Technology research tree
- Hazard and disaster systems
- Colony management and colonist needs
- Mission milestones and victory conditions
- Difficulty settings

## Core Gameplay Features

- **Hostile Environment:** Every aspect of Genesis Prime is designed to kill you - toxic atmosphere, extreme heat, acid rain, dust storms, volcanic eruptions, and radiation
- **Survival Pressure:** Limited starting resources create time pressure to establish water, oxygen, and food production before supplies run out
- **Resource Management:** Complex production chains where every resource matters - water feeds electrolysis for oxygen, which supports colonists who operate machinery
- **Technology Progression:** Research tree spanning from basic survival tech to advanced terraforming megastructures
- **Dynamic Events:** Environmental disasters, equipment failures, and random events keep players adapting
- **Long-Term Vision:** The ultimate goal of transforming the planet takes centuries of in-game time, creating a true legacy experience

## The Challenge

Can you guide humanity through its most ambitious undertaking? Will your colony survive the first 90 days? Can you establish a self-sustaining industrial base? Will future generations see breathable air and blue skies?

**Genesis Prime shows no mercy. Every victory is earned.**

## Development Status

This project is currently in the concept and design phase. The detailed planet concept and game mechanics documentation establish the foundation for a unique and challenging strategy game experience.
